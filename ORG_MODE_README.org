* Overview

This document outlines the custom Org-Mode configuration for Doom Emacs, designed to create a powerful yet simple system for managing tasks, projects, knowledge, bookmarks, and agendas.

The philosophy is to keep everything Doom gives us (pretty bullets, Roam, refile, agenda, etc.) and add a focused set of templates and workflows to enhance productivity.

* System Capabilities

**Core Components:**
- **Org-Agenda**: Time-based task and project management.
- **Org-Roam**: A Zettelkasten-style networked note-taking system.
- **Org-Capture**: Quick templates for capturing structured information.
- **Org-Refile**: Moving notes and tasks to their proper homes.

**File Structure:**
- =~/org/= : Root directory for all Org files.
- =~/org/inbox.org= : Default location for new tasks and unprocessed notes.
- =~/org/bookmarks.org= : A dedicated file for captured web links.
- =~/org/projects.org= : A high-level file for tracking active and completed projects.
- =~/org/notes/= : The directory for all Org-Roam knowledge notes.

**Key Features:**
1. **Smart Bookmark Capture**: Instantly saves a URL, title, selection, and timestamp.
2. **Two-Pane Daily Review**: Puts today's agenda and your inbox side-by-side.
3. **Structured Project & Task Templates**: Ensures consistency in how you track work.
4. **Specialized Org-Roam Templates**: Separate workflows for default notes, projects, and references.
5. **Unified Keybindings**: All commands are logically grouped under the =SPC n= prefix.

* Keybindings

All Org-Mode commands are grouped under the =SPC n= (notes/workflow) prefix for discoverability.

* Capture Templates

Capture templates are the heart of the workflow, allowing you to quickly and consistently add information to your system.

**Standard Org-Capture Templates:**
- =b= :: Bookmark: Captures a URL, title, and timestamp into =bookmarks.org=.
- =t= :: Task: Captures a TODO item with a scheduling prompt into =inbox.org=.
- =p= :: Project: Creates a structured project entry in =projects.org=.

**Org-Roam Capture Templates:**
- =d= :: Default: A flexible, general-purpose note.
- =p= :: Project: A note with a project-specific structure.
- =r= :: Reference: A note structured for capturing sources and citations.

**Quick Capture:**
- =q= :: Quick Add: A minimal, fast way to add a single line to your inbox.

* Workflow Examples

**Capturing a Bookmark:**
1. Copy a URL from your browser.
2. Press =SPC n c b=.
3. The template will automatically try to fill the URL and title.
4. Add any notes and press =C-c C-c= to save.

**Daily Planning:**
1. Press =SPC n d=.
2. The left pane shows your agenda for the day.
3. The right pane shows your inbox for processing new items.
4. Refile tasks from your inbox to project files or schedule them.

**Starting a New Project:**
1. Press =SPC n c p=.
2. Give the project a name.
3. Fill in the initial goals and high-level tasks.
4. Press =C-c C-c= to save to your projects file.

* User Stories

* Customization

This configuration is designed to be a solid foundation. You can easily:
- Add new capture templates to =org-capture-templates=.
- Create custom agenda views in =org-agenda-custom-commands=.
- Modify keybindings in the =general-def= block.
- Extend the file structure to suit your needs (e.g., adding a =work.org= file).

* Dependencies

This configuration relies on the following Doom modules:
- =:lang org= (with =+roam2= flag enabled)
- =:tools evil= (for keybinding states)
- =:editor evil= (for general-def integration)

Ensure these are enabled in your =init.el=.
